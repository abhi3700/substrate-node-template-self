# Bank Pallet

A pallet for handling financial systems of investment, loans, etc.

- [`Config`]
- [`Call`]

## Overview

Anyone can open FD (Fixed Deposit) by reserving some amount of currency with allowed maturity period.

During the FD period, the reserved amount cannot be used that's why need to be freed from the `free_balance`.
In order to receive interest, FD can only be closed after the `fd_epoch` (set by admin) is elapsed, else the reserved amount is returned
to the user without any interest as per the premature withdrawal facility and a penalty (0.5-1%) is charged. The `penalty_rate` is data
persistent & set by the root origin.

But, if the FD is closed after individual FD vault's `maturity_period` (set during opening), then the reserved amount is returned to the user with
accrued interest. The `interest_rate` is stored & set by the root origin.

The accrued interest comes from a treasury ðŸ’Ž account which is funded by the root origin. And the treasury account is funded via network's
inflation or balance slashing of the user in case of malicious activity.

NOTE: The runtime must include the `Balances` pallet to handle the accounts and balances for your chain. It has been
shown as a [dev-dependencies] in the `Cargo.toml` file.

## Interface

### Dispatchable Functions

## Build

Check if the dependencies are working properly:

```sh
$ cargo check -p node-template-runtime
```

Build the runtime's WASM binary with the following command:

```sh
$ cargo build -r
```

## Test

To run all the tests in a pallet:

```sh
$ cargo test -p pallet-bank
```

---

To run the individual test:

```sh
# example
$ cargo test -p pallet-bank --lib -- tests::it_works_for_default_value
```

Although there is a button shown above to run individual test in VSCode.
