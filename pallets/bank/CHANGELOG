# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

the IS formula.

- [ ] Added a RD vault for opening a RD account/vault.
- [ ] Add OCW (Off-chain worker) for setting the FD interest rate based on repo_rate & inflation fetched externally.
- [ ] We can also add the functionality of auto_maturity of FDs using hooks.
- [ ] After every few blocks, some balance is transferred to the TREASURY account.
  - L0 chain's inflation is transferred to the TREASURY account.
- [ ] Just immediately after the pallet deployment, the `FDParams` are supposed to be set. This can be done during genesis build.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.1.4] - 2023-07-17

### Added

- [x] Add tests:
  - `open_fd_fail_when_zero_maturity_period`
  - `open_fd_fail_when_maturity_period_less_than_fd_epoch`
  - `open_fd_fail_when_maturity_period_more_than_max_maturity_period`
- [x] Limit the max. value of `maturity_period` to be ∈ [`fd_epoch`, `MaxMaturityPeriod`]. This is to be done in `open_fd` extrinsic. The min. is `fd_epoch` & max. 5 years (set as `pallet::constant`).

### Changed

- [x] Modify the FD interest calculation as per the banking formula using `FixedU128` type into consideration for ensuring decimal values.

  ```txt
  A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)

  A = the future value of the investment (i.e. principal amount), including interest
  P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit)
  r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
  n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
  t = the number of years the money is invested
  ```

- [x] Moved `reset_treasury` from extrinsic to helper function for testing purpose.

### Fixed

## [0.1.2] - 2023-07-11

### Added

- [x] Added input sanitization for `principal_amount` to fall within the range of minimum & maximum FD amount i.e. ∈ [`MinFDAmount`, `MaxFDAmount`] during `open_fd` extrinsic.
  - [x] Also added tests for the same.
- [x] Added a power/logarithmic formula into a private function for Investment Score (IS). This is to be used in updating user's **IS** during `close_fd`.

```txt
IS = 1000 * (1 - (1 / (1 + MA / DF)))
```

### Changed

- [x] Bettered the existing interest & penalty amount calculation with the help of `Permill` type for rates (interest, penalty).

### Fixed

- Fixed the `penalty_amount` with 1% instead of 1.

```diff
if penalty == Zero::zero() {
--    penalty = One::one()
++    penalty = Permill::from_percent(1) * principal_amount;
}
```

## [0.1.1] - 2023-07-06

### Added

- [x] Added Tests for `unlock_for_membership` extrinsic.

### Fixed

- [x] Removed redundant code from `src/lib.rs` file.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-07-06

### Added

- [x] Added facility to open/close a FD account/vault.
- [x] Lock/Unlock tokens for gaining membership.
- [x] Root can define the interest rate for the FD vaults.
- [x] Tests added for all the extrinsics.
