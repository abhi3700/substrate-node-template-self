# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [ ] Added a storage parameter difficulty factor for using in the IS formula.
- [ ] Added a RD vault for opening a RD account/vault.
- [ ] Limit the max. value of `maturity_period` to be ∈ [`fd_epoch`, `MaxMaturityPeriod`]. This is to be done in `open_fd` extrinsic. The min. is `fd_epoch` & max. 5 years (set as `pallet::constant`).
- [ ] We can also add the functionality of auto_maturity of FDs using hooks.
- [ ] After every few blocks, some balance is transferred to the TREASURY account.
  - L0 chain's inflation is transferred to the TREASURY account.
- [ ] Just immediately after the pallet deployment, the `FDParams` are supposed to be set. This can be done during genesis build.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.1.2] - 2023-07-11

### Added

- [x] Added input sanitization for `principal_amount` to fall within the range of minimum & maximum FD amount i.e. ∈ [`MinFDAmount`, `MaxFDAmount`] during `open_fd` extrinsic.
  - [x] Also added tests for the same.
- [x] Added a power/logarithmic formula into a private function for Investment Score (IS). This is to be used in updating user's **IS** during `close_fd`.

```txt
IS = 1000 * (1 - (1 / (1 + MA / DF)))
```

### Changed

- [x] Bettered the existing interest & penalty amount calculation with the help of `Permill` type for rates (interest, penalty).

### Fixed

- Fixed the `penalty_amount` with 1% instead of 1.

```diff
if penalty == Zero::zero() {
--    penalty = One::one()
++    penalty = Permill::from_percent(1) * principal_amount;
}
```

## [0.1.1] - 2023-07-06

### Added

### Fixed

- [x] Removed redundant code from `src/lib.rs` file.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-07-06

### Added

- [x] Added facility to open/close a FD account/vault.
- [x] Lock/Unlock tokens for gaining membership.
